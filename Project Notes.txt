Book Catalog - Project Notes
-------------------------------

Initial SQLite installation:
NOTE: Support for creating the file based SQLite database: the original relied on a UWP service in Windows.Storage which is only available for packaged (?) apps (i.e. apps run from Windows Store?). Changed the target platform from net7.0-windows10.0.19.... to net6.0-windows10.0.22000.0 for all csproj files. Then added CommunityToolkit.Mvvm, CommunityToolkit.WinUI.UI.Controls, Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK references. After this, rebuild: now Windows.Storage is available, hence CreateFileAsync is available with the correct flags for creating a sqlite db.

NOTES: to obtain the taskbar icon(s); save a png file and then use the Package.appxmanifest Visual Assets to generate the required visual assets (overwriting the default "StoreLogo").
Obtaining an ICO file: from icons8.com, select download and then download the three favicon sizes (16,32,96). 
Use the Simple Icon File Maker (open the 96px icon) to create an ico file. Then press Save Icon.
